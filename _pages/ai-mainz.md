### AI Mainz (e.V. soon)

We are a group of (PhD) students meeting since 2020 discussing various aspects of "good" uses of AI, e.g., using prediction techniques to optimize the production of sustainable fuels (pre-print soon) or keeping each other up to date on current affairs in AI. We meet ~ once a month. Let me know if you are interested in joining. [Some of us founded a company](https://aira-holding.de/#/) and multiple collaborations with industry and academic partners already emerged (more to come).

#### Example Project: Predicting NOx emissions in Biochar Production Plants using Machine Learning

We present a novel method of optimizing the process of a biochar plant based on machine learning methods. We show how a standard Random Forest Regressor can be used to model the states of the pyrolysis machine, the physics of which remains highly complex. This model then serves as a surrogate of the machine -- reproducing several key outcomes of the machine -- in a numerical optimization. This, in turn, enables to reduce NOx emissions -- a key regulatory goal in that industry -- while achieving maximal output still. In a preliminary test our approach shows remarkable results, proves to be applicable on two different machines from different manufacturers, and can be implemented on standard Internet of Things (IoT) devices more generally.
